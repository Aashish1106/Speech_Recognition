# Speech_Recognition

Requirements:

Speech Recognition Module: It is a library with the help of which Python can recognize the command given. We have to use pip for Speech Recognition. 
 
PyAudio Module: It is a set of Python bindings for PortAudio, a cross-platform C++ library interfacing with audio drivers. We need to also install Pyaudio as the Speech Recognition module is dependent on it.

Step.1: Go to the cmd prompt(for windows os) then type:- pip install SpeechRecognition

Step.2: wait for package to install then type:- pip install PyAudio

Step.3:- If the above command doesnâ€™t work in windows then use the below commands in the windows command prompt:
                        pip install pipwin
                        
                        pipwin install pyaudio

We will be using Google Speech Recognition API for letting the software understand our given languages
